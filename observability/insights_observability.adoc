= Observability with Red Hat Insights

Red Hat Insights is integrated with {product-title-short} observability, and is enabled to help identify existing or potential problems in your clusters. Red Hat Insights helps you to identify, prioritize, and resolve stability, performance, network, and security risks. {ocp} offers local health monitoring through OpenShift Cluster Manager. OpenShift Cluster Manager collects anonymized, aggregrated information about the health, usage, and size of the clusters. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_insights/2021/[Red Hat Insights product documentation].

When you create or import a cluster, data from your managed cluster is automatically retrieved by Red Hat Insights. Each vulnerability report has its own custom resource (CR) that is created on the hub cluster.

*Required access*: Cluster administrator
